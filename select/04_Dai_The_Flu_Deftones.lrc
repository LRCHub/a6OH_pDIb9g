[00:45.66] I always wondered why it takes
[00:51.36] Fifteen stitches and a soft parody
[00:57.04] To make my eyes be like deceit
[01:08.51] I believe the sting proves heart to me
[01:27.51] 
[01:21.07] Now I know that you love me
[01:32.11] Thank God that you love at all
[01:47.11] 
[01:44.62] Dislocated at the joint
[01:50.14] Timing is everything in the bed
[01:55.94] 'Cause you'll sleep for hours
[02:01.11] To keep away
[02:06.85] Then sink the teeth and bat your eyes at
[02:26.85] 
[02:19.58] Now I know that you love me
[02:30.23] Thank God you love at all
[02:42.73] 
[02:40.96] What's the surprise I was right
[02:43.35] Here going off and going on
[02:45.99] What's the surprise I was right
[02:48.52] Here going off and going on
[02:51.36] What's the surprise I was right
[02:53.77] Here going off and going on
[02:56.05] What's the surprise I was right
[02:59.66] Here going off and going on
[03:13.16] 
[03:12.10] At least now I know that you
[03:30.37] Love me, thank God that you love at all
[03:49.87] 
[03:46.03] What's the surprise I was right here
[03:48.40] Going off going on dai the flu
[03:51.47] What's the surprise I was right here
[03:53.45] Going off going on dai the flu
[03:56.62] What's the surprise I was right here
[03:58.80] Going off going on dai the flu
[04:02.25] What's the surprise I was right here
[04:03.81] Going off going on dai the flu
[04:07.27] What's the surprise I was right here
[04:11.71] Going off going on dai the flu
