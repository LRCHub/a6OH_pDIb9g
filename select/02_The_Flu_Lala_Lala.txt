There's something in the way that you're moving
Makes me think I won't remember
Did you say my name in the ending
Did you make me do it all

And if I could drive my car
Then I would trash it
And if I could hold you back
You know I'd take it
And if I could be surprised
I swear I'd keep it
I don't want to lose a fight
I'll let you have it

There's something in the way of my vision
A wall's a wall's a wall
Did you say my name in the ending
Did you make me do it all
