I wanna jump but I'm afraid I'll fall
I wanna holler but the joint's too small
Young man rhythm got a hold on me too
I got a rocking pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu

Want some loving, baby, that ain't all
I wanna kiss her but the girl's too tall
Young man rhythm got a hold on me too
I got a rocking pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu

I wanna scream, I want you all to know
I would be running but my feet's are too slow
Young man rhythm got a hold on me too
I got a rocking pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu

Baby calling me now hurry home
I know she's leaving 'cause I'm taking too long
Young man rhythm got a hold on me too
I got a rocking pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu

Want some loving, baby' that ain't all
I wanna kiss her but the girl's too tall
Young man rhythm got a hold on me too
I got a rocking pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu

I wanna scream, I wanna scream
I wanna scream, I wanna scream
