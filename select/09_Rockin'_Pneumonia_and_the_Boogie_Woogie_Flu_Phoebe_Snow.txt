I wanna jump but I'm afraid I'll fall
I wann holler but the joints too small
Young man rhythm's got a hold on me too
I got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flue
Want some lovin', baby, that ain't all
I wanna kiss her but she's way too tall
Young man rhythm's got a hold on me too
I got the rocin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu
Young and then [Incomprehensible] the breeze
Young girls are tougher and tighter they squeeze
But the young gir's hip, head down the hall
I got the rockin' pneumonia, the boogie woogie flu
I want lovin' baby, that ain't all
It's the last call for alcohol
Hey now, young man rhythm's got a hold on me too
I got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flue, alright
I wanna love her but she ain't been home
I know she's leavin' but she's takin' too long
Yeah, young man rhythm's got a hold on me too
Got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu
Hey Lord, it's alright
Hey Lord, it's alright
Upright, you got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu
I wanna jump but I'm afraid I might fall
I wanna holler but the joint's too small
Young man rhythm's got a hold on me too
I got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flue
I want some livin', baby, that ain't all
I wanna kiss her but the child's too tall
Young man rhythm's got a hold on me too
Got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu, alright
